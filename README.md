## Rework required
I'm planning a full on rework for the bot at some point, the code input is easily abusable, the documentation sucks and there is almost nothing commented. The compiler should compile to Python instead of taking direct action.

# Meaning
The dotSlash is a discord bot that uses a custom language to run (your own) custom-coded commands. To make your commands, you will be using the SlashScript language that is coded into it.

# SlashScript
SlashScript is my language that is "hijacked" from the Python compiler. It only compiles to Python code, which compiles to binary. The compiler is included in here, and tbh it kinda sucks, but it works well enough, I guess.
