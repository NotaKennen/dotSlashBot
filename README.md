# Meaning
The dotSlash is a discord bot that uses a custom language (SlashScript) to run commands. It's currently in a beta phase, where it only has ~10 commands. 

# SlashScript
SlashScript is my language that is "hijacked" from the Python compiler. It only compiles to Python code, which compiles to binary. The compiler is included in here, and tbh it kinda sucks

# Discord invite 
with administrator: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1121295399601319958&permissions=8&scope=bot

without administrator: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1121295399601319958&permissions=2048&scope=bot

It technically taking doesn't need admin, but for future purposes I'm gonna do both.
KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BOT IS *NOT* HOSTED RIGHT NOW, IT WILL ONLY WORK WHEN I'M DEBUGGING (so kinda useless ig)
