## Dotslash
Dotslash is a bot in Discord which allows server owners to make their own commands without having to host their own bot. The bot uses it's own language called SlashScript to make commands. You can learn more about the language and the code in [Documentation](https://github.com/NotaKennen/dotSlashBot/blob/main/documentation.md).

[Basic permissions](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1183430549189165116&permissions=2048&scope=bot)
[Administrator permissions](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1183430549189165116&permissions=8&scope=bot)
The bot doesn't really need Administrator, but it's useful in case some new features get added.
