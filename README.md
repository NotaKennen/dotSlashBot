# Meaning
The dotSlash is a discord bot that uses a custom language to run (your own) custom-coded commands. To make your commands, you will be using the SlashScript language that is coded into it.

# SlashScript
SlashScript is my language that is "hijacked" from the Python compiler. It only compiles to Python code, which compiles to binary. The compiler is included in here, and tbh it kinda sucks, but it works well enough, I guess.
